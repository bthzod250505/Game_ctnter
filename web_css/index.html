	If you're looking for a good PC game to play, you've come to the right place. There are a lot of video games in this round up that'll entertain you, and they're neatly organized by genre. Steam users (and if you're a PC gamer, how aren't you one?) should visit PCMag's Steam Curator page and Steam Discussion Group, too. Our reviews live there, as well as several themed lists featuring highly regarded titles.

Please recognize, however, that this is not a historical examination of the most groundbreaking PC games. Uh-uh. Sure, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain redefines stealth-based action and the Forza Horizon series is the definitive open-world racing franchise, but they didn't make it into this guide based purely on those metrics. Simply put, this an ever-expanding collection of entertaining titles you should buy if you own a gaming desktop or gaming laptop.

To clarify, games don't need to have been released within the calendar year to qualify for this roundup. Any game that's still available and still considered excellent when ranked against the best of today is eligible. We think that's the most useful approach to helping you decide which video games deserve space on your PC's hard drive, and which aren't worth consideration even when their prices are cut by 85 percent during a Steam sale.

In our newest update, we've added a whopping 13 games: Brawlhalla, Carrion, Death Stranding, Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout, Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2: Anniversary, Halo 3, Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition, Hotshot Racing, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Spellbreak, Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2.</h3></p>

<p><h2>How We Pick 'Em</h2>
 <h3>Compiling this guide was no small undertaking. PCMag's in-house and freelance reviewers have played a ridiculous number of PC games over the years, so creating criteria for inclusion was essential. Here's what we came up with. To be included, a game must have been reviewed by PCMag, still be available for purchase, and received a rating of 3.5 stars or greater.
 
The first requirement is to ensure that we can give you more insight into a game. Yes, this guide goes into some depth on each game entry, but the ability to link to a full review benefits those looking for a deeper cut. The second point we've already covered. The third point required a bit of pondering. We didn't want to set the star rating so low that nearly all PC games qualified for the guide, yet we didn't want to set the star rating so high that we exclude quality B-tier games, such as Dead Island and Split/Second. For now, 3.5 stars is the happy medium, but, as we review more games, we may have to be choosier, to keep the list at a manageable size.</h3>
<h2>Explore Our Picks</h2>
<h3>There are currently more than 150 games in this PC gaming guide, so making navigation as simple as possible was an extremely high priority for our creative commandos. The games are grouped alphabetically by genre, and the titles in each category are listed in alphabetical order. Simply select a genre, say fighting games, and the page jumps to that section. Easy!

Sadly, two games have been removed from this roundup due to being delisted from digital game stores: Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 and The Walking Dead. It's a game preservation issue that developers need to address to ensure that titles stick around for future purchase.

In addition, you should make sure to secure your PC while gaming. We suggest checking out our roundup of the best VPNs for gaming, a roundup of PCMag-tested virtual private networks. Not only will a VPN prevent people with ill intent from snooping your network, but it may enable you to, say, spoof your IP address so that you access games in other countries. Explore our reviews to learn about the VPN services that add the least latency to your gaming sessions.
